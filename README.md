This is not an advice column. But, I will answer your questions. I don't promise that the answers will be any good, but I'll try to find the right balance between schmaltzy and funny. Like an episode of Community.

This isn't legal advice. I'm not a lawyer anymore. Or at least that's what people tell me. And these are my opinions, not my employers.
